<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
Fidcoin stock trading is a web app that allows multiple users to practice trade stocks during market's opening time (9:30am - 4:00pm) on Wed, 14 July 2021 without using real money. A new user is given a default account with $10,000 virtual money and a watchlist of 05 random stocks. When the market closes at 4:00pm every day, all the orders are reset (deleted) so that user can restart the next day.

Due to the scope of this project, I couldn't purchase a paid account to get realtime data from broker platforms. My solution is to get historical data of 14/07/21 and let users only trade on that day. Data from backend is sent to frontend via websocket instead of http requests.

### Built With
* Java 11
* Spring Boot 5.3.6
* Hibernate
* MySQL
* Angular 11
* StompJS
* ApexChart.js
* YahooFinance
* Amazon Web Services (S3, EC2, NGINX)

### Features
* Execute market and limit orders. For limit orders, if the price reaches the pre-defined, the order will be filled and converted its status from "working" to "filled".


* Display the position of owned stocks, including their realtime P/L based on their current market value.


* If there's a new order, change in stock prices, account is immediately updated.


* Allow multiple users trading at the same time.


* When a user (e.g., U_001) purchases a stock (e.g AMZN), other users (e.g., U_002, U_003) will get a notification about U_001's transaction (e.g "U_001 has just purchased AMZN"). This feature is built by design pattern "Observable".


* Automatically schedule to cancel(delete) orders when the market closes at 4:00pm on every day without restarting the server.


* Display candle charts by using data from YahooFinance library to get historical quotes and ApexCharts.js to display the chart.


* Build a watchlist to track favourite companies. Perform CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations and display realtime stock prices in the watchlist.


* Follow news related to the watchlist. 


* Deploy frontend and backend on Amazon Web Service using S3, NGINX, and EC2.
